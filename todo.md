# Things To Do

---

##### [FINISHED] Pending Deletion

* TinyFS need a proper pending deletion system to avoid dangling references. Current implementation is straight up missing this feature.

##### Animation System (priority: High)

* Add animation system now that skeletons are working properly. Just don't delete them right now unless you want to turn your pc into a work of art (descriptor set being deleted mid <Pipeline - Command Buffer> usage issue).

##### Ray Tracing? (priority: LOW)

* Adding ray tracing support via Vulkan RTX extensions? Who knows.
