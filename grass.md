üåø Grass Height ‚Üí Color Relationship (Blade Scale)
Grass Height	Typical Color	Why
Short / Young	Bright Green, Lush	New growth, high chlorophyll, still moist
Mid	Normal Green	Standard healthy mature growth
Tall / Overgrown	Yellowish-Green to Pale Yellow	Older, dryer, less chlorophyll, may be wilting or going to seed

Interpretation: As the grass gets taller, it becomes less green and more yellowish, since older blades often dry out or start dying back from the base.

‚õ∞Ô∏è Terrain Height (Placement Height) ‚Üí Color Relationship
Terrain Elevation	Typical Color	Why
Low elevation (valleys, plains)	Rich Green	More moisture, better soil, more nutrient accumulation
Mid elevation (rolling hills)	Light Green	Average growing conditions
High elevation (ridges, cliffs)	Pale Green, Yellowish	Windier, less soil, less moisture, more sun exposure

Interpretation: As terrain gets higher, grass tends to be less hydrated and more sun-exposed, leading to yellowing or dullness.

üåæ How Placement (Terrain Elevation) Affects Grass Height
Terrain Type	Elevation	Typical Grass Height	Why
Valleys / Lowlands	Low	Tall	Moisture collects, nutrients accumulate ‚Äî grass grows more densely and higher
Flat Plains	Mid-low	Medium to Tall	Generally fertile and stable growing ground
Hills / Slopes	Mid-high	Medium or Sparse	Soil erosion, runoff, less stable root conditions
Highlands / Ridges / Cliffs	High	Short / Patchy	Windy, dry, less soil depth, low nutrients ‚Äî stunts growth
Wetlands / Marshes	Low	Very Tall or Reedy	Tall, thin grass-like plants due to excessive water and competition for light
