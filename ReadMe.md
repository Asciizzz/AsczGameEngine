# "Will be called something else when I think of a name for the game"

## What I used

- Vulkan SDK
- SDL2 ("I DON'T HAVE FUCKING SDL2" "YOU HAVE SDL2 IT CAME WITH YOUR VULKAN")
- glm (for math and shit)

## What I learned

- That Vulkan is a pain in the ass


## Too lazy? Copy this

`cmake --build build --config Release`
`cmake --build build --config Debug`
`./build_portable.bat` if you want a version that can run on virtually any machine that hasn't gone through the 2 world wars
